# Data Analysis Project - Iris Data set

The Project assignment involves researching the Fishers Iris dataset. 
There are a number of tasks to be carried out during the research and analysis of the dataset. 

I have included an analysis.py python script and a Juypter notebook that steps through the code and goes through the analysis of the dataset.

Looking at the readme file that comes with the dataset we need to carry out the following tasks :

* Read in the Iris Data set
* Check the Iris Data set
* Clean the Iris data
* What questions can we ask of the Iris data set
* Univariate Analysis
  * Histograms for each numeric variable
  * Univariate per Class
  * Analyzing the Summary statistics for the 3 Species
  * Histograms per Species/ Class
  * Boxplots
* Bivariate Analysis
  * Scatter Plots
  * Pearson Correlation Coeficient 
  * What further analysis would I like to carry out
* Interesting Analysis of Iris Data set by others
  * Yet Another Iris EDA by Aditya Jetely
  * Iris Dataset - Exploratory Dtaa Analysis by Lalitha Rajesh
* Summary of Analysis

These tasks are outlined in the Juypter notebook.

## How to run the python Code
I hava included an analysis.py which when run will run the code and carry out the following :

* Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file called analysis.txt
* Saves a histogram of each variable to png files
* Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables
* Prints out checks on the Iris data set and also Correlation Coefficients

I have also included a Juypter notebook called analysis.pynb which steps through the code and explains the analysis carried out

## Investigations into the data set 
I have oulined the investigations I have carried out in the Juypter notebook.
This included both univariate and bivariate analysis.

## Interesting Analysis of Iris Data set by others

### Yet Another Iris EDA by Aditya Jetely
I came across a very interesting analysis of the Iris Data set by Aditya Jetely.
The URL is :- https://towardsdatascience.com/eda-of-the-iris-dataset-190f6dfd946d

The first thing is he does a thorough check of the data set looking for duplicates and missing values.
There are two commands that I will use in the future, one command prints out the actual duplicate rows and 
shows where the null values are. These are the commands :

shows actual duplicate rows => iris_df[iris_df.duplicated()]
missing values => isnull().sum(axis=0)

Aditya goes through the scatter plots in detail which is good. he could probably have highlighted what variables 
show weak relationships for the species. What I do like is the correlation heatmap which identifies the strong and
weak correlation coefficients. However the heatmap would be more useful if teh author done it per class/ species.
Finally the author provides a good conclusion and mentions that versicolor and virginica species can be hard to separate.
The author doesn't mention that Versicolor has a high correlation coefficient of 0.78 for variables petal length and petal width.
Also, virginica has a correlation coefficient = 0.86 for variables sepal length and petal length which is a strong relationship.

### Iris Dataset - Exploratory Dtaa Analysis by Lalitha Rajesh
This is another article I came across was looks and modelling techniques
The URL is => https://www.kaggle.com/code/lalitharajesh/iris-dataset-exploratory-data-analysis/notebook

One criticism is that the author doesn't provide enough of information on coding of the modelling carried out.
They could also have provided more information on the results of the univariate and bivariate analysis carried out.
The GaussianNB() and K means clustering models are used for modelling. The GaussianNB model provides an accuracy score of 0.96
which is high. I would like to explore the modelling techniques on teh Iris dataset. 



## Summary of dataset
We can see from carrying out both Univariate and Bivariate analysis that we can distinguish between each of the three Iris plant species. 

Univariate analysis shows that Petal length and Petal Width are good variables to distinguish between Setosa and the other two Iris plant species. By using univariate analysis the variables don't seem to be good and distinguishing between Virginica and versicolor species.
With Bivariate analysis and analyzing the scatter plots or using the correlation coefficient method we can see there are positive high coefficients where variables have strong relationships. For Setosa there is a strong relation between sepal width and sepal length with a correlation coefficient of 0.74. The highest correlation coefficient for versicolor is 0.78 which shows there is a strong relationship between petal length and petal width. Lastly for virginica there is a correlation coefficient of 0.86 which is very high and is for variables sepal length and petal length.
